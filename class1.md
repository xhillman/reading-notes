# Markdown and GitHub: An Overview

Markdown is used to format and style files in GitHub. It is commonly used in README files and other files used to present content within GitHub.

The basic syntax is summarized here:

**Headings** are created using one to six `#` symbols followed by a space and some text.

```
# The biggest heading
## The second biggest heading
###### The smallest heading
```

> # The biggest heading

> ## The second biggest heading

> ###### The smallest heading


**Paragraphs** are made by simply typing your text and leaving a blank space between one or more lines.

```
This is a paragraph.

And so is this.
```

You can make text **bold** by using two `*` symbols on either side of a word like this:

```
A bold **word** in a sentence.
```

Using a single `*` makes words *italic*, like this:

```
An italic *word* in a sentence.
```


You can make blockquotes by using the > symbol before a paragraph.

```
> This is a blockquote.
```

> This is a blockquote.

You can also do multi-line blockquotes by putting a > symbol with an empty line.

```
> My first sentence.
>
> My second sentence.
```

> My first sentence.
>
> My second sentence.

You can make **unordered lists** by using the `-` symbol:

```
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
```

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

And **ordered lists** by numbering your items.

```
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
```

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
