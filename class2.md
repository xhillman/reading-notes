# Choosing a Text Editor

Let me start by saying that the text editor you end up choosing is a personal choice. They're all fairly similar, though some may come with some additional
features that others don't offer. Can you use it to build the project you're working on from start to finish? Yes? Then you've got the text editor for you.

The best advice I could give would be to use the text editor that you enjoy using the most. It's that simple.

### What is a text editor?

A text editor is one of the most important tools you'll use as a developer. It's a piece of software that allows you to write and manage text.

Some features you might look for in a text editor are:

1. **Code completion** - basically auto-complete for your code. As you type, it will suggest possible outcomes based on what you originally typed and auto-fill your selection.
2. **Syntax highlighting** - colorizes different attributes of your code for better readability.
3. **A variety of themes** - changes the overall colors of your text editor for a better user experience. (Pro Tip: Use a dark mode theme. It'll be easier on your eyes.)
4. **A healthy selection of extensions to choose from** - allow you to add extra functionality to your editor that you wouldn't otherwise have access to.
