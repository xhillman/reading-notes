## Choosing a Text Editor

Let me start by saying that the text editor you end up choosing is a personal choice. They're all fairly similar, though some may come with some additional
features that others don't offer. Can you use it to build the project you're working on from start to finish? Yes? Then you've got the text editor for you.

The best advice I could give would be to use the text editor that you enjoy using the most. It's that simple.

## What is a text editor?

A text editor is one of the most important tools you'll use as a developer. It's a piece of software that allows you to write and manage text.

Some features you might look for in a text editor are:

1. **Code completion** - basically auto-complete for your code. As you type, it will suggest possible outcomes based on what you originally typed and auto-fill your selection.
2. **Syntax highlighting** - colorizes different attributes of your code for better readability.
3. **A variety of themes** - changes the overall colors of your text editor for a better user experience. (Pro Tip: Use a dark mode theme. It'll be easier on your eyes.)
4. **A healthy selection of extensions to choose from** - allow you to add extra functionality to your editor that you wouldn't otherwise have access to.

## The Command Line

The command line is a text based interface on your computer, also known as the Terminal. It can achieve the same results as the Finder on a Mac, however, instead of using your mouse to navigate and create things such as new folders and files, you use text commands.

### Common command line commands

`pwd` or present working directory, is used to find out which directory or file you are currently interacting with.

`ls` or list, is used to find out what files or directories are in the current directory. `ls -l` will format this list to make it more readable.

`cd` or change directory is used to change into another directory or file.

`mkdir` or make directory is used to create a new directory or folder.

`touch` is used to create a new file within the current directory.

`clear` is used to clear the terminal of all existing text. It does not change the current file or directory that you are in.

### Some closing notes on files

- Everything is technically a file

  - Text files, directories, your keyboard and even your monitor is a file

- File extentions are the 2 - 4 characters after a file name that denote what *type* of file it is

- You **can** use spaces in file names, but be careful as the command line may consider some words characters and not recognize them as part of the file name (anything inside quotes is considered a single item)

- The `\` symbol is an escape character which nullifies the speical meaning of the next character
