# Hi, I'm Xavier

## I'm learning how to code at Code Fellows

This is where I'll keep my notes during class and keep track of my reading assignments.

To me, a **growth mindset** is knowing that where I am now is *not* where I'll always be.

Some reminders to stay in a growth mindset:

- Make the best decisions you can with the information you have.
- If I got 1% better today, it was a win.
- I don't know the answer right now, but where can I find it?
- The way I'm doing this may not be the best way. How can I use this as an opportunity to become better?
