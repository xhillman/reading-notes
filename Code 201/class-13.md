## Local Storage

### Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?

Typically, the state of an application would be saved on a server-side program and you'd be able to know which state to revert to based on a username. A developer would use local storage on a web application when they want to save the state of the page without requiring the user to sign up.

### What information should not be stored in local storage?

Personal information such as passwords, social security numbers or answers to security questions should not be stored on local storage.

### Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?

Local storage can only store data with a type of 'string'. You can covert data such as objects by using the `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()` functions.
