## Debugging

### Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error

A syntax error is a spelling error that causes the program to stop working part way through or not run at all. A logic error is when the syntax is correct, so the program will run but may produce the intended results.

### List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them

I have mostly run into syntax errors caused by missing comparison operators in for loops and misspelling variable names. I have also run into a few logic errors cause by misordered nested loops.

### How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

When I finally get a job in the industry, I know that the code I run will not always be perfect and I will have bugs. It will be very useful to have the ability to correct them without outside help. Also, if the day comes and I need to review others code, it will be ideal to be able to point out and correct errors in code written by others.

### How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

The JavaScript Debugger tool allows you to keep an eye on variables to be sure you are getting the expected results and also set breakpoints that allow you to pause your program so you can identify any issues.

### Define what a breakpoint is

A breakpoint is a location in your code that you want to pause the program execution so that you can identify problems that are breaking your code.

### What is the call stack?

The call stack is a section in the dev tools that shows you what code has already been executed to get to the current line.
