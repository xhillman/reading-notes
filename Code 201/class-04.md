## HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

### HTML Links

#### To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

The `<a>` element.

#### The `href` attribute contains what information?

The `href` attribute contains the web address that the link will lead to.

#### What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

> - Screen reader users like jumping around from link to link on the page, and reading links out of context.
>
> - Search engines use link text to index target files, so it is a good idea to include keywords in your link text to effectively describe what is being linked to.
>
> - Visual readers skim over the page rather than reading every word, and their eyes will be drawn to page features that stand out, like links. They will find descriptive link text useful.

### CSS Layout

#### What is meant by “normal flow”?

Normal flow is the way web page elements lay themselves out if the developer hasn't changed the layout in any way.

#### What are a few differences between `block-level` and `inline` elements?

`block-level` elements fill all of the available inline space of their parent element and grows to accommodate the content. `inline` elements are only the size of the their content. You cannot set width or height of `inline` elements.

#### ___ positioning is the default for every html element

**Static** positioning is the default for every html element.

#### Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element

Using absolute positioning on an element gives you the ability to create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements. It also gives you a bit more freedom in regards to positioning because absoluely positioned elements can be specified to be a certained distance from the "containing elements" sides.

#### What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

Absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to it containing element whereas fixed positioning *usually* fixes an element relative to the visible portion of the viewport.

### JS Functions

#### Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation

Function declaration is when you create a function. Function invocation is the act of running or using the function.

#### What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Parameters and arguments are the same thing.

### Miscellaneous

#### Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey

Learning from fellow students: I know that when it comes to programming, their is rarely only one way to do something. I also know that my way of doing things isn't always the most efficient. This aspect of pair programming will help me with identifying better ways of writing my code that I may not have thought of before.

Job interview readiness: Knowing that I will most likely have to do some sort of pair programming during interviews, getting comfortable with pair programming now will allow me to perform more effectively when it comes time to land a job.
