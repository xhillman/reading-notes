## Images, Color, Text

### HTML Media

#### What is a real world use case for the `alt` attribute being used in a website?

Some real world use cases for the `alt` attribute are when the user is viually impaired and using a screen reader, if the browser doesn't support the image type and SEO.

#### How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?

You can improve the accessibility of images by using the `alt` atrribute and captions.

#### Provide an example of when the `figure` element would be useful in an HTML document

The `figure` element is useful when you want to semantically link an image to it's caption, such as in the case when you have a large number of images on a page.

#### Describe the difference between a `gif` image and an `svg` image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community

A `gif` is used for simple images and animations whereas an `svg` would be used in an icon that needs to be drawn accurately at different sizes.

#### What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?

You would use a `PNG` or `WebP` image type to display screenshots because they are lossless and won't make the image fuzzy or unclear.

### CSS

#### Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge

The foreground color of an HTML element would be the color of the content, like the text color. The background color would be the color that appears behind the content.

#### Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?

I would start by asking them what color they would like to define the blog. This would be the base color. Then I would use an online tool to create a color palette based on color theory. The selected colors can be used to change the background color of the whole site or selected elements as well as some select sections of text. I would be sure to keep readability in mind while selecting colors for individual elements.

#### What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?

When choosing a font, you should consider whether or not the font is available across all systems (ie. it is a web safe font).

#### What do `font-size`, `font-weight`, and `font-style` do to HTML text elements?

- `font-size` is used to make text larger or smaller.
- `font-weight` is used to set the boldness of text.
- `font-style` is used to turn italic text on and off.

#### Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an `h1` element

You could use the `letter-spacing` property to add spacing between each indiviual letter or `word-spacing` to add space between each word.
