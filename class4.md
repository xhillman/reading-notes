## What is a wire frame?

Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers to define and plan the information hierarchy of their projects.

The process focuses on how the designer wants the user to process information from the site.

Wireframing helps you plan the layout and interaction of your site without the distraction of colors, typeface choice or text.

## Wireframe Examples

## Things to consider

How you go about wireframing largely depends on how much emphasis there will be on visual design. The process from design to implementation can look like:

- Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design
- Sketch > Code
- Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code
- Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code

While you can use pen and paper to wireframe, some free online tools include:

- UXPin
- InVision
- Wireframe.cc
- Google Drawings
- Miro

## 6 Steps to make a wireframe

### 1. Do your research

In order to effectively create a wireframe, you need to know your audience by way of user research and complimenting this with further competitor and industry research. How do I need to present this information to the audience? How are other people presenting this information?

### 2. Prepare your research for quick reference

It helps to keep requirements you've discovered in your research handy for quick access while designing.

### 3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out

Wireframes can get messy very quickly. You'll need to have a clear understanding of where users are coming from and where you want them to go in order to stay on track with your design. Good information architecture will ensure users are self-sufficient while on your site.

### 4. Draft, don't draw. Sketch, don't illustrate

Wireframes are an outline. You don't want to drown yourself in detail, so don't think about aesthetics just yet.

### 5. Add some detail and get testing

Add details in a way that would naturally process on screen. Your basic wireframe is your skeleton, now you want to add a bit of muscle. In this step you can add things such as:

- Navbar at the top next to your logo
- Simple, instructional wording
- Trust building elements
- Simple icons to indicate future functionality

### 6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes

Once you have all this documentation, you can start to work on your first prototype. Take your sketch and start to transfer your design into a tool like Adobe XD, Sketch or Figma.

### Three key principles

1. **Clarity** - Your wireframe just needs to answer the question of what the site is, what the user can do there, and if it satisfies their needs.

2. **Confidence** - bj
