# Intro to CSS

CSS is used to make webpages look better. It controls how the HTML elements on your page look.

CSS is a rule-based language. You define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.

`h1 {

    color: green;

    text-size: 5rem;

}`

In this example, the `h1` is the *selector* that determines which HTML element is being styled.

Inside the curly braces `{ }` we find the *declarations* which take the form of property-value pairs. We specify the property (`color` in the above example) before the colon, and we specify the value of the property after the colon (`green` in this example).

As seen in the above example, selectors can have more than one declaration applied to them.
